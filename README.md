# IPCheck
This Python script creates a GUI application for checking the reachability of IP addresses. The user can specify a list of IP addresses from a file or manually, and the script will ping each IP address and display the results in a text box. Additionally, the script can generate a pie chart depicting the percentage of UP and DOWN IP addresses.
